# TASK 2: Using Python or PHP or Java or Ruby or JavaScript
# Prompt the user for a number either on a form input or the terminal. Depending on whether the number is even or odd, display  either “odd” or “even” to the user.
#  Hint: how does an even / odd number react differently when divided by 2?
number=float(input('enter number: '))
if number%2==0:
    print('number is even')
    if number%4==0:
      print('number divisible by 4')
else:
    print('number is odd')

# Once you learn functions,revisit this and write this code inside a function.
# Extras:
# If the number is a multiple of 4, print out “divisible by 4”.
# Once you learn functions,revisit this and write this code inside a function.
